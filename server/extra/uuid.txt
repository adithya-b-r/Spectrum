UUID v1 → based on timestamp + MAC address (can leak system info).
UUID v3 → based on a namespace + MD5 hash (deterministic).
UUID v4 → random-based (most widely used, collision probability is negligible).
UUID v5 → namespace + SHA-1 hash (deterministic, safer than v3).

For usernames, you usually want something:

✅ Globally unique
✅ Not guessable
✅ Easy to generate without coordination

That’s why UUID v4 is most common — it uses random numbers, so even if millions of users sign up at the same time, they won’t clash.
